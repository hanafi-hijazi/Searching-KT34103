    "\n",
    "Here, we learn about a specific kind of problem solving - building goal-based agents that can plan ahead to solve problems. In particular, we examine navigation problem/route finding problem. We must begin by precisely defining **problems** and their **solutions**.\n",

    "Search algorithms can be classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uninformed search algorithms**: Search algorithms which explore the search space without having any information about the problem other than its definition.\n",
    "    * Examples:\n",
    "        1. Breadth First Search\n",
    "        2. Depth First Search\n",
    "        3. Depth Limited Search\n",
    "        4. Iterative Deepening Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Informed search algorithms**: These type of algorithms leverage any information (heuristics, path cost) on the problem to search through the search space to find the solution efficiently.\n",
    "    * Examples:\n",
    "        1. Best First Search\n",
    "        2. Uniform Cost Search\n",
    "        3. A\\* Search\n",
